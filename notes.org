* Git Hooks
** General
   Provide nice ways to automate common behavior, and provide checks for different things, such as spelling errors or commit message format
   Samples are provided under under .git/hooks
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ls .git/hooks
     # applypatch-msg.sample  post-commit.sample   post-update.sample     pre-commit.sample  pre-rebase.sample          update.sample
     # commit-msg.sample      post-receive.sample  pre-applypatch.sample  pre-push.sample    prepare-commit-msg.sample
   #+END_SRC
*** Examples
**** pre-commit  - Spelling of Error Messages
**** pre-commit  - Ignored Tests
**** commit-msg  - Ensuring correct message format
**** post-commit - Emailing QA upon defect completion 
**** post-commit - Update version one
